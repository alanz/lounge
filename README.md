======

Simple blog application based on Haskell and CouchDB

Installation
------------

Grab yourself a CouchDB (version 1.0). We recommend the installer from the http://couch.io website, if you're running a current Ubuntu.

Install the Haskell Platform, either via your package manager or from http://hackage.haskell.org/platform . This step is not necessary if you already have a proper Haskell environment with GHC and cabal set up.

Clone the lounge repository an execute `cabal install` in that directory.

Now execute `lounge` and check `http://localhost:3000`.
